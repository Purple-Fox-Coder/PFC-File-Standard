# File-Standard
 My personal standard for creating, storing, naming, and etc. of files, functions, folders, classes, variables, and more.
 Much of this is taken from other standards (which I will link if I am aware of them.)
 
 This branch goes over my general standard, covering general non-programming focused files and folders
