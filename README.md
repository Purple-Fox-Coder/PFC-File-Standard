# File-Standard
 My personal standard for creating, storing, naming, and etc. of files, functions, folders, classes, variables, and more.
 Much of this is taken from other standards (which I will link if I am aware of them.)
 
 This file goes over my general standard, covering general non-programming focused files and folders.

 The goal is to create an easy to explore through terminal and consistent file saving system for sharing with peers and locating files\
 while remaining as simple as possible.\

# Folders:
Folders are to be named simply by what they contain.  For simplicity of access through console any spaces should be underscores: _  
Alternatively, the folder names can be named with camelCase. (folderName, thisIsAFolderName) or a mixture of both styles to seperate 
information.\
\
If applicable, the group/project name or an abbreviated version of the group/project name should be included first before the name of the folder.  
Alternatively you can put the folders relating to a group inside a folder named after that group.  I.E. ./NASA/someFolder/  
Group/project names should be capitalized always.  I.E. Discord, NASA, UnitedStates, ...\
\
Descriptive names are preferred over numbered or alphabetical names I.E. ./colorGroup/1/ or ./colorGroup/2/ should be 
./colorGroup/color1/ and ./colorGroup/color2/ or something more specific if possible like ./colorGroup/red/

***Example folder names:***
1. ./NASA/roverProgram/
2. ./NASA_roverProgram/
3. ./Android/plans/
4. ./Discord/bots/managementBot

# Files:
Files are to be named by what they contain, just as with folders.  They should be more specific than folders though.  Any spaces 
should be replaced with underscores, and camelCase can be used in place of underscores. I.E. (fileName, thisIsAFileName).  A 
mixture of both styles may and should be used to help distinguish information in the filename.\
\
The filename should start with a 3 letter abbreviation of the group or project they are meant for (or the full name of such if 
applicable.)  This should be in all lowercase.  I.E. nas_fileName.txt, dis_fileName.txt, etc.\
\
The filename may contain more information than the name and group/project abbreviation if needed.  This information should be 
included after the file's name.\
\
***Example file names:***
1. nas_roverProgramPlan.txt
2. nas_roverData.txt
3. and_appPlan.txt
4. dis_managementBotPlan.docx
